`rock-paper-scissors` is an open-source Rust library and interactive game designed for developers to create or customize implementations of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. It adheres to **clean design principles**, offering modular functionality, safe initialization, and robust error handling.

## Features

### Library Highlights
- **Customizable Game Logic**:
  - Enums and structs encapsulate game logic for modularity and easy customization.
  - New `MoveType::None` variant ensures safe initialization for moves.
  - Methods like `MoveType::random_move` simplify randomization, while `MoveType::from_user_input` handles inputs gracefully.
- **Winner Determination**:
  - Built-in logic determines the winner of each round with clear rules (`PlayerMoves::check_who_wins_round`).
- **Score Management**:
  - Tracks user and enemy wins during the game with a `Scores` struct.
  - Allows checking the game's end (`Scores::check_for_winner`) or resetting (`Scores::reset`).
- **Safe Initialization**:
  - The `PlayerMoves::new` method initializes moves (`user_move` and `enemy_move`) as `MoveType::None`, reducing errors during uninitialized states.
- **Game Settings**:
  - The `GameSettings` struct allows developers to configure customizable game-winning conditions, such as "first to X wins."
  - A prebuilt configuration `GameSettings::first_to_3()` is included for quick usage.
- **Friendly Output Utilities**:
  - Human-readable string conversion for enums like `MoveType` and `Winner` provides better readability and interaction.

### Game Highlights
- Interactive gameplay through `MoveType::from_user_input()` for user moves.
- Head-to-head matches with a randomly generated opponent.
- Input validation ensures smooth, error-free gameplay.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use or play the `rock-paper-scissors` library, ensure you have the following installed:

- Rust (v1.64 or higher)
- Cargo, for building and running the library or game.

### Installation

To use the `rock-paper-scissors` library in your project, include it in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rock-paper-scissors = "0.4.2"
```

For the interactive game:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hijknight/rock-paper-scissors.git
   cd rock-paper-scissors
   ```
2. Run the game using Cargo:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

## Library Overview

### Core Components

#### **Enums**

1. **Winner**
- Represents round outcomes: `User`, `Enemy`, or `Tie`.
- Includes `Winner::convert_to_string` for clear textual output.  
  Example output: `"You win!"` or `"You lose!"`.

2. **MoveType**
- Represents available moves (`Rock`, `Paper`, `Scissors`) and includes a new variant:
  - **`MoveType::None`**: Represents an uninitialized state or invalid move, ensuring safe initialization.
- Key methods:
  - **`MoveType::random_move`**: Generates a random move for non-interactive gameplay.
  - **`MoveType::from_user_input`**: Validates and converts user input to move types.
  - **`MoveType::convert_to_string`**: Converts moves (like `MoveType::Rock`) into a human-readable format (`"Rock"`).

#### **Structs**

1. **PlayerMoves**
- Bundles the user's and the enemy's moves for a single round.
- Features:
  - **`PlayerMoves::new`**: Initializes moves as `MoveType::None` for safe usage.
  - **`PlayerMoves::check_who_wins_round`**: Determines the round winner.
  - **`PlayerMoves::build`**: Completes initialization with user input and a random enemy move.

2. **Scores**
- Tracks the cumulative wins for both the user and the enemy.
- Features:
  - **`Scores::check_for_winner`**: Determines if a player has reached the game's win condition (e.g., first to a certain number of wins).
  - **`Scores::reset`**: Resets scores for a new game.

3. **GameSettings**
- Facilitates customizable game-winning conditions.
- Features:
  - `first_to` field: Specifies the number of wins required to end the game.
  - **`GameSettings::new`**: Creates a `GameSettings` instance with default configurable values.
  - **`GameSettings::first_to_3`**: Predefined configuration for a game set to "first to 3 wins."

**Example:**

```rust
use rock_paper_scissors::{Scores, GameSettings, Winner};

let game_settings = GameSettings::first_to_3();
let mut scores = Scores::new();

// Simulate some rounds
scores.user_wins = 3;

// Check for game winner
let winner = scores.check_for_winner(&game_settings);
assert_eq!(winner, Ok(Winner::User));
```

## Playing the Game

Hereâ€™s an interactive example of how to play a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors using the library:

```rust
use rock_paper_scissors::{PlayerMoves, Scores, Winner, MoveType, GameSettings};

fn main() {
  let mut scores = Scores::new();
  let game_settings = GameSettings::first_to_3();

  println!("Welcome to Rock-Paper-Scissors!");

  // Game loop
  while scores.check_for_winner(&game_settings).is_err() {
    let player_moves = PlayerMoves::build();

    let round_winner = player_moves.check_who_wins_round();
    println!(
      "You chose {}. Enemy chose {}.",
      player_moves.user_move.convert_to_string(),
      player_moves.enemy_move.convert_to_string(),
    );
    println!("Result: {}", round_winner.convert_to_string());

    // Update scores
    match round_winner {
      Winner::User => scores.user_wins += 1,
      Winner::Enemy => scores.enemy_wins += 1,
      Winner::Tie => (),
    }

    println!(
      "Current Scores -> You: {}, Enemy: {}",
      scores.user_wins, scores.enemy_wins
    );
  }

  // Display final results
  let game_winner = scores.check_for_winner(&game_settings).unwrap();
  println!("Game over! {}", game_winner.convert_to_string());
}
```

## Error Handling

### Key Error Scenarios
- **Invalid user input**:
  - If the player enters invalid input (e.g., letters, out-of-range numbers), the game reprompts them via `MoveType::from_user_input`.
- **Uninitialized states**:
  - The `MoveType::None` variant prevents invalid states during custom logic or gameplay setup.
